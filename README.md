# Wk-9

I started by using google cloud to create the mhn virtual machines.
Using the google cloud platform was pretty straight forward.
A linux machine was created with an associated honeypot.
A firewall was created with poor security to trick a potential attacker to gravitate towards it with http unsecure.
Kali Linux was then used to scan the computer to see where the network was vulnerable.
